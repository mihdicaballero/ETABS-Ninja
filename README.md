# ETABS-Ninja ðŸ¥·

Welcome to the ETABS-Ninja repository! This repository is a collection of Python functions and scripts that utilize the ETABS API to empower users in efficiently interacting with their ETABS models, setting parameters, extracting information, and creating engaging presentations and reports.

## Overview

The ETABS-Ninja repository aims to harness the potential of the ETABS API by providing a curated set of functions and scripts that enable users to leverage the API's capabilities through Python.

## Features

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks and streamline your workflow within ETABS using the ETABS-Ninja scripts. 

- **Model Interaction:** Interact with your ETABS models programmatically. Set parameters, modify structural elements, apply loads and constraints, and perform other operations, all through Python scripts.

- **Data Extraction:** Extract valuable information from your ETABS models using the ETABS-Ninja scripts. Retrieve section properties, member forces, displacements, reactions, and more. Use this data for analysis, reporting, or further processing.

- **Presentation Generation:** Leverage Python's capabilities to transform your ETABS model data into compelling presentations, reports, or visualizations. Generate plots, graphs, diagrams, or customized outputs to effectively communicate your structural analysis findings.
